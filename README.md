## Overview

This project analyzes the **quality of care (QoC)** received by women undergoing sterilization at **public health facilities** in India using data from the **National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4, 2015â€“16)**.  
It combines NFHS individual-level data with district-level facility indicators to construct **Structure** and **Process** indices through *Principal Component Analysis (PCA)* and estimates a **multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression model** with random intercepts at the district level.
